# Overview

This repository contains our standardization of reason codes for terminating licenses to Fortress. It provides an XML of the reasons that we use in the compliance processes.

## Intentions

We share this XML to:

1.  help compliance teams integrate standardized termination codes into their risk management systems,
2.  provide a reference for defining responsibilities around potential termination scenarios and
3.  share our approach to the standardization of license termination reasons for Fortress.
